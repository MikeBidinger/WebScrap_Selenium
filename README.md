# Web scraping using Selenium with Python
Within this project various examples are applied to automatically scrap webpages:
- Opening and controlling a webbrowser (using a Chrome-driver, see link for more info and the correct "STABLE" Chrome-driver-version: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/home)
- Find (and interact with) elements on webpages
- Write (or read) data to (or from) JSON files
